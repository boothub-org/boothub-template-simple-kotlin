After generating the project skeleton and creating a working copy on your computer, you can build the project with:

----
gradlew build
----

You can also build an uncompressed distribution by executing:
----
gradlew installDist
----

Let us consider that your project is called `my-project` and your main application class is named `MyApp`.
Then, running the start script found in the `build/install/myProject/bin` directory, the following text should appear on your terminal:
----
Hello from MyApp!
----

[[idea]]
== IntelliJ Idea

- start the IntelliJ Idea IDE
- open _build.gradle.kts_


[[eclipse]]
== Eclipse

- start the Eclipse IDE
- install a recent version of https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Buildship]
- import the project using the Gradle Project wizard

[[versioning]]
== Versioning

The file `gradle.properties` contains variables that are used to create a version string conforming to the https://semver.org[semantic versioning] standard.
The names of these variables are prefixed by the camelCase representation of the project name, for example:
`myProjectVersionMajor`, `myProjectVersionMinor`, `myProjectVersionPatch`.

Additionally, a boolean variable (named for example `myProjectReleaseBuild`) is used to specify whether the current build represents a release or a snapshot.

By editing the values of these variables you can change the version of your project.

For example, to bump your project version to `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT`, your `gradle.properties` should contain:
----
myProjectVersionMajor = 1
myProjectVersionMinor = 2
myProjectVersionPatch = 3
myProjectReleaseBuild = false
----

== License header check

The Gradle build script uses the https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin[license-gradle-plugin]
to check if your source files include the header provided in the `license-header.txt` file.

== Publishing to JCenter and Maven Central

The Gradle task `bintrayUpload` lets you publish your artifacts to https://bintray.com/[Bintray].
You can then https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_centralrepositories.html#_including_your_package_in_jcenter[include your packages in JCenter]
and https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_syncingwiththirdpartyplatforms.html#_syncing_artifacts_with_maven_central[synchronize them with Maven Central].

Before being able to execute the `bintrayUpload` task, you need to configure your credentials.

=== Credentials
Your Gradle build script uses the https://github.com/stevesaliman/gradle-properties-plugin[gradle-properties-plugin],
which allows you to configure additional project properties in the `gradle-local.properties` file.

This is the file in which you should configure your credentials.
Since `gradle-local.properties` is already listed in your project's `.gitignore` file, your credentials will not be committed to git.

To create this file you can simply copy the provided template file `gradle-local-template.properties` to `gradle-local.properties`.
The content of this file is shown below:
----
signingKeyId = A0B1C2D3
signingSecretKeyRingFile = /users/jsmith/gpg/jsmith.gpg

bintrayUser = jsmith
bintrayKey = a0b1c2d3e4f5a0b1c2d3e4f5a0b1c2d3e4f5a0b1
----

You need to configure the appropriate values for the above properties, which are used for signing your artifacts and for granting you access to Bintray.

The signing credentials consist of:

* the public key ID (an 8 character hexadecimal string)
* the absolute path to the secret key ring file containing your private key
* the passphrase used to protect your private key

The passphrase of your private key is a very sesnsitive information, therefore it is not stored in the `gradle-local.properties`.
Instead, Gradle will ask you to enter it each time you execute the `bintrayUpload` task.

See the https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html[GnuPG documentation] and the
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html[Gradle signing plugin] for details on how to create and configure your signatures.

The Bintray credentials consist of your Bintray user name and your
https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/interacting/interacting_interacting.html#anchorAPIKEY[Bintray API Key].
See the documentation of the https://github.com/bintray/gradle-bintray-plugin[gradle-bintray-plugin] for more details.
